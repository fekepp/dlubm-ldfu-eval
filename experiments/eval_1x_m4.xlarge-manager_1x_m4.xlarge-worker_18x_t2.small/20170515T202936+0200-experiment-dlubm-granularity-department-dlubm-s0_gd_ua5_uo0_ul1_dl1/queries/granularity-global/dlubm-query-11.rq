# Query11
# Query 11, 12 and 13 are intended to verify the presence of certain OWL reasoning
# capabilities in the system. In this query, property subOrganizationOf is defined
# as transitive. Since in the benchmark data, instances of ResearchGroup are stated
# as a sub-organization of a Department individual and the later suborganization of 
# a University individual, inference about the subOrgnizationOf relationship between
# instances of ResearchGroup and University is required to answer this query. 
# Additionally, its input is small.
